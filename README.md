# About Me

I'm Bruno, a self-taught full-stack developer based in Hungary. I have been building web applications since 2020. My primary tools are TypeScript, Node.js, and React.

I am fluent in English, German, and Hungarian.

Outside of coding, I am a regular at the gym. It helps me stay active and focused.
